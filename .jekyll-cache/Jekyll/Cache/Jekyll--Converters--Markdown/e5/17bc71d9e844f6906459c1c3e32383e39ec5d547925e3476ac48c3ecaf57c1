I"u<p>Asperger’s Network is a website that I built <i>ages ago</i> from the ground up in HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript/JQuery. The importance of it to my life and <i>several</i> others cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>Until now, Asperger’s Network has run on a hacky-copied-from-another-website-and-then-modified codebase. This has worked well for us. It looks a little something like this:</p>

<div class="embedimg">
    <img src="/images/blog/aspergers-network-3.0/aspnt-2.0.jpg" alt="Asperger's Network 2.0 Forums Index" />
    <div class="caption">
        <p>Asperger's Network Version 2.0 Beta 2.1</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The design, I feel, is starting to date. The code almost definitely is ageing. I have multiple dependencies that are stopping me from upgrading the site easily, the first one being mcrypt, and I don’t want to have to re-hash all my passwords again.</p>
