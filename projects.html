    <h2>introduction</h2>
    <p>Over the years, my projects have been wide and varied. I have always endeavoured to custom build what I use, to a level that I would use on a daily basis.</p>
    <h2>current projects</h2>
    <p>Currently, my projects are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="//aspergers.network">Asperger's Network</a> - a community website for people on the Autism Spectrum - custom coded from the ground up.</li>
